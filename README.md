# Face-detection-mediapipe
This repository demonstrates how to perform detailed face detection using the MediaPipe FaceMesh model. It includes features such as facial contours, lips, face oval, left eye, left eyebrow, right eye, right eyebrow, and tesselation for a comprehensive understanding of facial landmarks.

## Overview
FaceMesh is a powerful tool for facial landmark detection, enabling applications like facial recognition, emotion analysis, and augmented reality. This project leverages the MediaPipe library to efficiently detect and track these facial features in real-time.

## Features
1. Real-time face detection with comprehensive facial feature landmarks
2. Easy integration into your existing projects
3. Minimal dependencies

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies 
3. Run the provided code to start detecting and visualizing facial landmarks

## Usage
Use the provided code as a starting point for your projects, or integrate the face detection and landmark visualization into your applications. You can customize the code to suit your specific use cases or requirements.

## Features 
1. Facial contours for precise face shape analysis
2. Lips are for tracking mouth movements
3. Face oval for boundary analysis
4. Left and right eyes with landmarks for gaze tracking
5. Left and right eyebrows for expression analysis
6. Tessellation for a comprehensive 3D understanding of the face

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the MediaPipe team for providing a robust library for facial detection 
and landmark tracking.
